Natural ecosystems,“Choose” evolutionary path through DNA,"Can ecosystems decide? Ecosystems benefit from the natural experiments that happen in loosely connected parts of the network and can provide significant creativity as well as resiliency. They’re however harder to align and control. Nature effectively chooses, over time, based on alternatives created by mutations of genes and the environment; it expresses those genes in the short term through epigenetics (for instance metabolic changes in response to a famine, transmitted to the next generation); and mutations of RNA seem to show longer-term ""memory"" of the reaction to biological event (such as in the case of mounting a defense to a bacteria)",2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1,1,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
