Modelling humanitarian relief in Haiti,Model behaviours and interventions for crisis planning,"During and following a crisis situation, decision making at both the individual and the collective level changes rapidly due to the severe disruption caused to people’s daily lives. To manage and respond to a crisis effectively, and to aid humanitarian efforts during a crisis, it is important to understand and anticipate how different groups and individuals will react  n a spatially and temporally precise way. Challenges in understanding people’s behaviour during a crisis are often compounded by a lack of spatial data in less developed countries. Even in cases where spatial data is available, it often lags behind what has changed on-the-ground – for instance when the physical landscape has altered due to a natural disaster. What is the CCI  olution? This case study outlines a prototype of an agent-based model (ABM) integrating GIS, crowdsourced geographic information and other sources of publicly available data, which seeks to explore how aid might be distributed to better support affected communities. The model uses the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti which is estimated to have killed 230,000 people and  eft more than 1.6 million people homeless. The model explores how affected communities search for food following an earthquake and allows the user to explore different scenario options for aid distribution. How is it being done? The model uses a diverse range of crowdsourced data including geographic information about population density, relative level of devastation, existing transportation networks, location of aid centres, and environmental parameters. The researchers used publicly available (open) data to estimate population density and OpenStreetMap data. The simulation produces a map showing the movement of individuals throughout the environment and the spread of information about aid (e.g. food) availability, as well as graphs tracking how individual agents use ifferent aid centres over time. Over time more and more agents become aware of their nearest food distribution point as well as other distribution points, as information spreads throughout the system. Agents then evaluate if it is worthwhile for them to go and get food. They do this by planning the shortest path to the food via the road network.

America in One Room,Use deliberative democracy polling to investigate better political decision-making,"To practice democracy at its purest, in a time of political polarization, an experiment called America in One Room, organized by Helena magazine in collaboration with Stanford Univeristy, brought together the most representative sample of the electorate in U.S. history. A stratified random sample of 523 registered voters, recruited by NORC at the University of Chicago, was identified out of millions of Americans through a rigorous scientific process in order to represent the political, cultural, and demographic diversity of the American electorate. Helena brought each American to a single location — a resort in Dallas, Texas. For four days, the delegates participated in an unprecedented deliberation on the critical issues facing the United States. In a process called “deliberative democracy polling”, the 523 participants began by taking an in-depth questionnaire, stating their views on five key issue areas identified in earlier polling as most vital to the 2020 presidential election. The group was then given a 60-page briefing document, prepared and vetted by a distinguished group of policy experts from across the political spectrum. The document was balanced with arguments for and against specific policy proposals across the five issue areas. The group was then given a 60-page briefing document, prepared and vetted by a distinguished group of policy experts from across the political spectrum. The document was balanced with arguments for and against specific policy proposals across the five issue areas. During the ensuing 4 days, the America in One Room group vigorously and respectfully deliberated on these polarizing issues with one another. Their discussions took place in two formats: moderated, representative small group settings and evening plenary sessions, where the group convened as a single unit to ask live questions to 2020 presidential candidates and a bipartisan selection of experts and political figures ranging from the former White House Chief of Staff and former leaders of the National Security Council, Congressional Budget Office and White Economic Policy advisory. At the end of the final day, the group took the original questionnaire again. The outcome was a landmark data set that represented the “will of the people” — what Americans think about values, candidates, and policy issues when given the chance to think deeply, engage with different opinions, and deliberate in a fact-rich and respectful environment.",1.0,,1.0,2.0,,1,,,2.0,,,,,1.0,,,,2.0,,,1,,,,,,,,,

Collector DAO,Use decentralized autonomous organizations to support artists,"These entities unite contributors around certain assets, or collectibles. NFTs are a common choice.

The acquisition of NFTs and other collectibles also has a fundamentally different tenor — involvement is as much, or more, about fandom and affinity as it is about alpha. These groups often take on the role of curators for certain projects, too, adding a kind of institutional longevity and support. SquiggleDAO, for example, exists to support and collect generative art, while MeebitsDAO collects Meebits NFTs. PleasrDAO acts as an “art collecting empire” across projects.

"Italian, South Korean governments",Respond to health threats,"Contagion is the spread of a virus in a network of people. Curbing it requires isolation of network spreaders. To do so, South Korea implemented network sensors (pervasive testing), and by tracing back the networks of the infected was able to contain the spread. Compare that with Italy, which – thanks to the signal from Asia - had a head start in sensing the threat. Italy started testing early, though not at as pervasively as South Korea. But the actual response of both authorities and the public was too slow and uncoordinated to prevent the virus from spreading in cross-generational households and in the dense social fabric of Italian society. Neither security rules (prohibiting gatherings and tracking spreaders) nor social norms changed fast enough. The collective response was a democratic one without executive powers to coerce the collective. Each person chose how to behave for too long, and then it was too late to stop the spread. After a few weeks, Italy’s fatalities overtook China’s, a country whose population is fifty times larger.

Therefore, scientific dissemination is affected in timeliness, quality, and fairness. Here, to solve this issue, researchers Trovò and Massari propose a blockchain-based incentive system that rewards scientists for peer-reviewing other scientists' work and that builds up trust and reputation. They designed a privacy-oriented protocol of smart contracts called Ants-Review that allows authors to issue a bounty for open anonymous peer-reviews on Ethereum. If requirements are met, peer-reviews will be accepted and paid by the approver proportionally to their assessed quality. To promote ethical behavior and inclusiveness the system implements a gamified mechanism that allows the whole community to evaluate the peer-reviews and vote for the best ones.

Project Dorian,"Label datasets for AI by frontline responders, human-in-the-loop technology development","Ensuring human oversight of algorithms after deployment can help to identify and correct these errors in a timely manner. For this project, a group of volunteers from the Montgomery County Community Emergency Response Team (MCERT) helped to check and correct labels assigned by the AI classifier. This participatory approach, known as human-in-the-loop, was used to verify the classifications being made by the system and correct any mistakes in real time. The process also resulted in a novel image dataset with expert labels of damage to further train the algorithm and improve its accuracy during future deployments.During the two-week period that followed the landfall of Hurricane Dorian, the system was deployed to collect and filter social media images. Approximately 160,000 images were tagged as relevant by the system, with ~26,000 of these containing some damage content. All images that the system ranked as severe or mild were sent for human validation. Using a dedicated web-interface for microtasking to support humanitarian efforts, local domain experts from MCERT examined this evolving sample, performing a two-stage verification. They first checked if the image contained damage content and then assigned a severity level based on a predetermined taxonomy. The research team also developed a detailed tutorial to ensure that all labellers were approaching the task in a consistent manner. The corrections made by the community responders helped to identify common types of errors made by the algorithm. For example, the AI system struggled with images taken from afar or in low-light and poor resolution settings. Isolating this weakness helped the technical team to develop targeted improvements and the response teams to better understand the potential added value of the AI tool for their operations during crisis response.

Muonde Trust,Enable Agro-Pastoral Restoration in Zimbabwe,"3 particularly when competing interests and behaviours of different stakeholder groups need to be accounted for. Ecological restoration initiatives have often ignored the role of indigenous people and local groups in maintaining ecosystems and failed to account for the local history and political context. In Mazvihwa Communal Area, Zimbabwe, there are ongoing land management problems where woodland grazing areas are increasingly being converted to cropland. After the model was finalised, the Muonde team held workshops with local traditional authorities, including the local Chief, the ward head (machinda), and the individual village heads (sabhuku). In these workshops, they used the model to visualise different actions and resulting impacts, which helped local stakeholders to discuss land management practices, past actions that had resulted in drought and the challenges associated with their agro-pastoral system. These discussions led to policy changes that allowed the reuse of fallow fields for farming. Months after these workshops, the community members reported that the model helped them realise the interaction between their different behaviours, understand the systemic drivers in the ecosystem and to take responsibility for the collective action that was necessary to improve outcomes.

Sepsis Watch,Enable participatory AI modeling in healthcare,"Sepsis Watch is a sepsis detection and management platform that uses deep learning to predict the likelihood of a patient developing sepsis. It was co-created by a multidisciplinary team that included hospital staff and a technical team to improve the clinical outcomes associated with sepsis, which was a major issue for the local hospital. Machine learning technologies are increasingly being developed for healthcare settings. These models are often created by engineering teams outside of the clinical environment and implementation decisions are made at the leadership level, rather than with the involvement of clinicians or nurses who are expected to use and integrate the tool into their existing workflows. Research has also suggested that machine learning models in healthcare have poor generalisability. This means their performance suffers when they are used in real-world settings where the local data follows
statistically different patterns to the datasets they were trained on. The Sepsis Watch model was created in close collaboration with clinicians over two and a half years, with participation integrated throughout the AI development pipeline. Throughout the process the team placed a strong emphasis on developing trust between the individuals involved and also in the technology solution. The thirty month co-design process for Sepsis Watch eventually resulted in its integration into the clinical setting. This process resulted in securing institutional buy-in and retaining ownership over decision making among frontline staff. Doctors and nurses developed new processes for decision making that made use of the tool alongside their expertise. As the frontline users of Sepsis Watch, nurses also reported that the tool helped them expand their professional skills. (Source: Nesta UK)",1.0,,,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,,,1,1.0,1.0,,,,,,1.0,1,,,,,,,,,
Project Jetsons,Enable participatory AI modeling for refugee displacement prediction,In 2017 frontline workers in Dollo Ado in Ethiopia appealed to the UNHCR Innovation Service to design an algorithm that would help them to better predict the flows of displaced people in order to better plan for and manage their arrival.

They conducted detailed interviews with both frontline workers and displaced Somalis to better understand the specific factors associated with migration in the region. This allowed them to isolate ten core variables to focus on for the first iteration of the predictive model. (Source: Nesta UK),1.0,,,1.0,1.0,,,,1.0,,,1,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
WeBuildAI,Enable participatory modeling for a food donation matching algorithm,"412 Food Rescue provides a ‘food rescue’ service that matches expiring food from donating organisations such as grocery stores with recipient organisations. Its success relies on efficient matching between donations and recipients as well as a volunteer network to transport the packages. They developed a participatory framework known as WeBuildAI to model the preferences of different stakeholders involved in the service and ultimately satisfy their needs and priorities. For example, if the algorithm optimised efficiency, volunteers would have shorter driving times and the areas closest to donating organisations would receive a disproportionate share of donations. Prioritising equity of distribution on the other hand could make it more difficult to recruit and retain volunteers. By involving groups who prioritised efficiency or equity to varying degrees in the algorithm design, the researchers hoped that all of the participants would continue engaging with the service and that the distribution of donations would be more equitable.

Companion Modelling: Sequía,"Model behaviours and
interventions for crisis mitigation, Modelling
behaviours and interventions for crisis recovery ","Natural resource ecosystems (e.g. forest, agricultural, land-use management, water) are complex to model and understand because they are affected by a wide range of factors including both environmental and human behaviours. Knowledge related to ecosystems and the factors that impact them is distributed between numerous stakeholders, such as scientists, local residents and frontline managers, who often have distinct (and sometimes competing) interests. This makesit difficult to understand the short- and longterm’ impacts of environment and resource management decisions, and to tackle resource issues that require collective decision making and agreement. In the case of the Sequía Project in Uruguay, local farmers were struggling to identify and plan adaptation strategies in the face of severe drought. What is the CCI solution? Companion modelling uses Agent BasedModels (ABMs) and role-playing games to help represent and simulate socio-economic systems for natural resource management.  This participatory approach uses the collective intelligence of a wide range of stakeholders to design and implement ABMs, and features interactive simulations enabling participating stakeholders to test different scenarios and outcomes. How is it being done?The underlying concept of companion modelling is to use role-playing games to enable stakeholders to interact with a model or simulation of a specified resource ecosystem, and to modify the behaviour of various agents in order to understand the impact of different uses of resources. Over a series of workshops with stakeholders, the model is specified and explored while participants discuss the implications of various management decisions. A companion modelling approach is a participatory and iterative process whereby stakeholders are involved in the definition and design of the questions, models, simulations and outputs. In turn, it is possible to collectively explore scenarios to better understand how a desired situation may be reached. The Sequía project used Cormas, a simulation computer programme that uses ABMs. It is an open-source platform used by environmental resource researchers internationally to facilitate the design, monitoring and analysis  f simulation scenarios.

"Doodle.ai, X.ai",Facilitate logistics of scheduling synchronous collaboration ,"Companies like doodle.ai and X.ai have started attacking the problem to make the user experience a lot more intuitive (for instance using email’s natural language). Other applications that integrate with Microsoft Outlook, and Microsoft themselves are actively working at the problem, to eliminate the labor-intensive work of finding common slots. Limitations due to information security restrictions will likely soon be resolved, and the only constraint will be user awareness. It is probable that one of the most useful applications of AI will then be the work of finding common slots that minimize the inconvenience for all participants.",1.0,,,1.0,,,,,1.0,,,2,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Eli Lilly, IBM, Google",Predict events,"Prediction platforms that combine the opinion of people have been around since the early 2000s, for instance in the form of “prediction markets”177 where individuals can “bet” on specific outcomes (like the future trend in a market or the success of a new product) and the platform’s algorithms combine and weigh the results. Companies like Eli Lilly, IBM and Google have all used them extensively in the past to obtain “signals” to improve their development of new solutions. IBM’s alphaWorks used to track downloads of “alpha” (i.e. very early release) solution to predict future demand.
