"Ants, bees, birds",Sense the environment,"These sensing knowledge feeders don’t require a significant amount of cognition to deliver effective results. Ants emit pheromones that enhance their collective behavior by making each individual ant a sensor of the environment around them. This optimizes routes used for the scouting of food with remarkable accuracy. Interestingly, ants don’t just optimize the search direction. They also optimize the amount of “ant resources” deployed in the search, to ensure their collective energy is used correctly at the right time. Some do so by simply modulating the speed of exit from the anthill, achieved by sensing the speed of incoming ants. Returning ants bump into those who are ready to exit. The faster the rate of return (signaling more food available, because it took less time to find it) the more ants are sent out. A bee’s “dance” serves a similar purpose.",2.0,,,2.0,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

C2PA,Verify provenance and authenticity of web information,"The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity is a consortium backed by ARM, Twitter and Microsoft that issued a protocol with guidelines for disclosure of information. This protocol uses a technique called hard binding, which uses crypotgraphy to encode and bind information together to facilitate auditability. The News Provenance Project uses cryptography to provide confidence on news reporting. ",,,,2.0,,,,,1.0,,,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,
Natural ecosystems,“Choose” evolutionary path through DNA,"Can ecosystems decide? Ecosystems benefit from the natural experiments that happen in loosely connected parts of the network and can provide significant creativity as well as resiliency. They’re however harder to align and control. Nature effectively chooses, over time, based on alternatives created by mutations of genes and the environment; it expresses those genes in the short term through epigenetics (for instance metabolic changes in response to a famine, transmitted to the next generation); and mutations of RNA seem to show longer-term ""memory"" of the reaction to biological event (such as in the case of mounting a defense to a bacteria)",2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
