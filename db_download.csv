Project Dorian,"Label datasets for AI by frontline responders, human-in-the-loop technology development","Ensuring human oversight of algorithms after deployment can help to identify and correct these errors in a timely manner. For this project, a group of volunteers from the Montgomery County Community Emergency Response Team (MCERT) helped to check and correct labels assigned by the AI classifier. This participatory approach, known as human-in-the-loop, was used to verify the classifications being made by the system and correct any mistakes in real time. The process also resulted in a novel image dataset with expert labels of damage to further train the algorithm and improve its accuracy during future deployments.During the two-week period that followed the landfall of Hurricane Dorian, the system was deployed to collect and filter social media images. Approximately 160,000 images were tagged as relevant by the system, with ~26,000 of these containing some damage content. All images that the system ranked as severe or mild were sent for human validation. Using a dedicated web-interface for microtasking to support humanitarian efforts, local domain experts from MCERT examined this evolving sample, performing a two-stage verification. They first checked if the image contained damage content and then assigned a severity level based on a predetermined taxonomy. The research team also developed a detailed tutorial to ensure that all labellers were approaching the task in a consistent manner. The corrections made by the community responders helped to identify common types of errors made by the algorithm. For example, the AI system struggled with images taken from afar or in low-light and poor resolution settings. Isolating this weakness helped the technical team to develop targeted improvements and the response teams to better understand the potential added value of the AI tool for their operations during crisis response.
