Collector DAO,Use decentralized autonomous organizations to support artists,"These entities unite contributors around certain assets, or collectibles. NFTs are a common choice. NFT Curators (Collectors band together to pool both their capital and their collections, and with the resulting liquidity, they can support artists in new ways). While the accumulation of NFTs may also yield extremely favorable financial returns, these communities often have no intention of selling their items, at least in the short-to-medium term. The acquisition of NFTs and other collectibles also has a fundamentally different tenor — involvement is as much, or more, about fandom and affinity as it is about alpha. These groups often take on the role of curators for certain projects, too, adding a kind of institutional longevity and support. SquiggleDAO, for example, exists to support and collect generative art, while MeebitsDAO collects Meebits NFTs. PleasrDAO acts as an “art collecting empire” across projects. NounsDAO is the gathering point for holders of Noun NFTs, who receive a share in future Noun sales. Source: The Generalist",1.0,,,2.0,,,2.0,,2.0,1.0,,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,

Media DAOs,Use decentralized autonomous organizations to produce media,"Forefront, Bankless, and DarkStar are Media DAOs. These entities produce public content, often collaboratively.

Creator DAO,Use decentralized autonomous organizations to support artists,"Creator DAOs center themselves around an individual. Just like some fan clubs give an influencer’s most passionate supporters opportunities for consumption and interaction, DAOs have the capacity to do the same.

A number of creators adopt “social tokens” through products like Roll, which lay the groundwork for true Creator DAOs. Early movers include Leaving Records and Personal Corner.(Source: The Generalist)",1.0,,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,
