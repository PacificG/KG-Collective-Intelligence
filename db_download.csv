OpenLaw,Use blockchain for real estate registry,"In 2018 OpenLaw worked with various Australian lawyers to create an end-to-end real estate transaction platform that is built on the Ethereum blockchain and backed by ERC-721 NFTs. The platform enables the smooth transfer of properties through the minting of NFTs using the Australian government’s centralized records of all official land titles. While the platform is operable and successfully demonstrates the possibility of transferring land and real estate titles through blockchain technology, it would be necessary to first make changes to Australian law for the platform to be widely implemented (source Open Forest Protocol)",,2.0,,1.0,,,,,1.0,,,1.0,,,1.0,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,1.0,"Remember Decide Collaborate_ Market Collaborate_ Public sector, NGO Supply chain, real estate ","Remember Decide Collaborate_ Market Collaborate_ Public sector, NGO Supply chain, real estate  In 2018 OpenLaw worked with various Australian lawyers to create an end-to-end real estate transaction platform that is built on the Ethereum blockchain and backed by ERC-721 NFTs.
