395,395,Muonde Trust,Enable Agro-Pastoral Restoration in Zimbabwe,"3 particularly when competing interests and behaviours of different stakeholder groups need to be accounted for. Ecological restoration initiatives have often ignored the role of indigenous people and local groups in maintaining ecosystems and failed to account for the local history and political context. In Mazvihwa Communal Area, Zimbabwe, there are ongoing land management problems where woodland grazing areas are increasingly being converted to cropland. After the model was finalised, the Muonde team held workshops with local traditional authorities, including the local Chief, the ward head (machinda), and the individual village heads (sabhuku). In these workshops, they used the model to visualise different actions and resulting impacts, which helped local stakeholders to discuss land management practices, past actions that had resulted in drought and the challenges associated with their agro-pastoral system. These discussions led to policy changes that allowed the reuse of fallow fields for farming. Months after these workshops, the community members reported that the model helped them realise the interaction between their different behaviours, understand the systemic drivers in the ecosystem and to take responsibility for the collective action that was necessary to improve outcomes.
