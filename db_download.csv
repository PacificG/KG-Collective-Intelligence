Forums like Clubhouse and Twitter Super Follows showed that smaller audiences, relying on a more intimate connection with the creators, could also be financially attractive and, hopefully, yield more thoughtful, insightful, and civil information feeders.
At the end of 2020, the introduction of Clubhouse created a new hybrid: real-time audio-only conversations, in private invite-only rooms, where (typically) influencers host discussion in which participants can raise hand and intervene. This one-to-many model is de-facto a hybrid between social media (podcasting) and unified communications.

MIND is an automated open source platform created by UN Global Pulse that collects and processes data from a range of sources and presents this data through a single aggregated platform that all responders can use when coordinating response to a natural disaster. How is it being done? The platform is built on an automated data pipeline (using a number of APIs), allowing it to stream and analyse several non-traditional data sets all in one place. This includes data generated by affected communities local to the incident taking place and scraped from Twitter and Google searches, as well as information from Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap about the location, casualty reports from news sources, and data from the International Aid Transparency Initiative, showing details about projects and organisations in the affected areas. The automated collection and processing of the data is triggered based on disaster alerts received from the Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS), which is a global system aimed at closing information and coordination gaps.",2.0,,,,,1.0,,2.0,,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,"Sense Illuminate network Feed Community Connect Curate Public sector, NGO "

RapiD (Map with AI),Provide real-time situational information for more effective response,"For 15 years, thousands of volunteers have used OpenStreetMap (OSM) to create a free and open map of the world. The community of mappers help build OSM by adding manually captured data, importing and reviewing open public data or official data (such as satellite images) and annotating features like roads, highways and bridges. While mappers may be remote, local communities can also use the tool to map their local neighbourhoods. Despite the popularity of OSM, many areas remain unmapped, unvalidated or incorrectly labelled. This is mostly because crowd annotation of maps is time- and labourintensive for volunteers and finding an equivalent number of real-life validators is difficult. Maps are not static – particularly in vulnerable regions affected by conflict (such as where borders may be disputed) and environmental crises – so they may require remapping if an area experiences rapid changes in infrastructure. These areas need constant monitoring, which is difficult to achieve manually. Accurate maps play an essential role in crisis situations by supporting the response efforts of frontline workers, aid organisations, national and international government bodies by helping them to understand the scale of impact, and effectively target and coordinate relief. What is the CCI solution? The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a dedicated community that uses OSM to support responses to crises, such as urban floods and migration, by mapping vulnerable regions. In 2018, HOT launched the MapWithAI initiative (in partnership with Facebook) which elevates the collective intelligence of volunteers by using artificial intelligence (AI) to drive the speed, efficiency and scale of mapping efforts. How is it being done? MapWithAI uses computer vision to detect roads and terrain features of the streets on high-resolution satellite imagery. Trained using years of volunteer-labelled satellite data, complex patterns in images are identified by an algorithm known as a deep neural network segmentation model. This model estimates the probability that each pixel is part of a road, predicts and draws potential roads, and generates an enhanced image for the volunteer community through an editing tool called RapiD. Using RapiD, volunteers verify the AI generated roads, helping to identify errors in the model and contribute to its improvement. The project initially focused on the response to flooding in Kerala, India, but has since been integrated into the HOT volunteer-management platform for deployment on other projects. Project managers and volunteers can opt-in to use the tool or continue mapping without it. Using RapiD, volunteers are able to create maps of disaster affected regions more quickly. Projects carried out through the HOT task manager platform draw on contributions from a wide range of participants including local volunteers and frontline responders, particularly for validation of remote mapping efforts.

America in One Room,Use deliberative democracy polling to investigate better political decision-making,"To practice democracy at its purest, in a time of political polarization, an experiment called America in One Room, organized by Helena magazine in collaboration with Stanford Univeristy, brought together the most representative sample of the electorate in U.S. history. A stratified random sample of 523 registered voters, recruited by NORC at the University of Chicago, was identified out of millions of Americans through a rigorous scientific process in order to represent the political, cultural, and demographic diversity of the American electorate. Helena brought each American to a single location — a resort in Dallas, Texas. For four days, the delegates participated in an unprecedented deliberation on the critical issues facing the United States. In a process called “deliberative democracy polling”, the 523 participants began by taking an in-depth questionnaire, stating their views on five key issue areas identified in earlier polling as most vital to the 2020 presidential election. The group was then given a 60-page briefing document, prepared and vetted by a distinguished group of policy experts from across the political spectrum. The document was balanced with arguments for and against specific policy proposals across the five issue areas. The group was then given a 60-page briefing document, prepared and vetted by a distinguished group of policy experts from across the political spectrum. The document was balanced with arguments for and against specific policy proposals across the five issue areas. During the ensuing 4 days, the America in One Room group vigorously and respectfully deliberated on these polarizing issues with one another. Their discussions took place in two formats: moderated, representative small group settings and evening plenary sessions, where the group convened as a single unit to ask live questions to 2020 presidential candidates and a bipartisan selection of experts and political figures ranging from the former White House Chief of Staff and former leaders of the National Security Council, Congressional Budget Office and White Economic Policy advisory. At the end of the final day, the group took the original questionnaire again. The outcome was a landmark data set that represented the “will of the people” — what Americans think about values, candidates, and policy issues when given the chance to think deeply, engage with different opinions, and deliberate in a fact-rich and respectful environment.",1.0,,1.0,2.0,,1.0,,,2.0,,,,,1.0,,,,2.0,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,"Sense Decide Create Illuminate network Community Democracy Public sector, NGO "

Lao Environmental Protection,Improve urban waste disposal,"The UND Acceleratore Lab wanted to use collective intelligence to better understand what motivates communities to burn their waste. Using a combination of GIS mapping with satellite data, ethnography and town hall discussions in communities, they set out to create a better understanding of open burning in three villages around Vientiane. The team first created an Air Quality Index with GIS mapping to call attention to the effects of open burning on air quality. Although satellite images highlight the hotspots where burning takes place, the team realized this gave no insight about the reasons for this activity. Working with the local NGO, Disadvantage Children and Youth Development Association (DCYA), the Lab tapped into 20 volunteers to run community meetings that would help to fill these data gaps. The Lab used a combination of group deliberation, ethnography and microsurveys to enrich the mapping data with qualitative insights about the drivers of waste behavior in the villages. Working with community leaders, they organized six town hall meetings about waste management for the residents and local authorities. During the meetings, the villagers discussed their waste disposal practices and the environmental impact of open burning.

Common Social Accountability Platform (CSAP),Solicite ideas and priorities from communities for post-crisis rebuilding in Somalia,"Following decades of unrest, Somalia is starting to move towards recovery. However, government capacity to deliver services and respond to citizen needs remains limited. A lack of established accountability mechanisms not only prevents government decisions from being informed and guided by citizen input and feedback, but also reduces citizens’ trust
in government to respond to their needs. In addition, there are limited channels and opportunities for meaningful interaction between citizens and the numerous aid agencies delivering support in the country. The charity Africa’s Voices launched the Common Social Accountability Platform (CSAP) in Somalia in 2018 to increase the inclusion of citizens in decision making across governance, humanitarian and development programmes. CSAP tackles the gap in connecting Somali citizens to decision making through a CI approach by maximising the scale and inclusivity of dialogue between citizens and authorities. In addition, CSAP provides a robust digital platform to gather and analyse evidence on citizen perspectives (including by using AI). The charity partners with a wide range of aid-related organisations and national and international government bodies (including Somalia Stability Fund, Oxfam, European Union, UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office) to deliver projects, and provide recommendations to external stakeholders (such as policymakers). CSAP adopts a collective intelligence approach by crowdsourcing opinions from affected communities, producing citizen-generated data, and conducting complex data analytics (including AI) to analyse feedback at scale. The platform uses Africa’s Voices’ interactive radio method for building dialogue and gathering public opinion. Radio programming and SMS messaging create a platform that Somali citizens actively engage in, whilst simultaneously allowing for feedback received from citizen SMS messages to be robustly analysed, understood and ultimately, acted upon. Their method gathers insights from conversations held in local languages, on a scale otherwise unattainable for qualitative methods. The data collected is interpreted by qualitative research techniques, data science and AI to analyse discussions in local languages. The platform uses Coda 2, a software tool built in collaboration with the University of Cambridge, which allows interpretation and effective labelling of large volumes of textual data. The tool uses AI to augment the interpretive capacities of researchers rather than to automate data analysis, enabling them to listen to and interpret a larger set of conversations in local languages.

Sepsis Watch,Enable participatory AI modeling in healthcare,"Sepsis Watch is a sepsis detection and management platform that uses deep learning to predict the likelihood of a patient developing sepsis. It was co-created by a multidisciplinary team that included hospital staff and a technical team to improve the clinical outcomes associated with sepsis, which was a major issue for the local hospital. Machine learning technologies are increasingly being developed for healthcare settings. These models are often created by engineering teams outside of the clinical environment and implementation decisions are made at the leadership level, rather than with the involvement of clinicians or nurses who are expected to use and integrate the tool into their existing workflows. Research has also suggested that machine learning models in healthcare have poor generalisability. This means their performance suffers when they are used in real-world settings where the local data follows
statistically different patterns to the datasets they were trained on. The Sepsis Watch model was created in close collaboration with clinicians over two and a half years, with participation integrated throughout the AI development pipeline. Throughout the process the team placed a strong emphasis on developing trust between the individuals involved and also in the technology solution. The thirty month co-design process for Sepsis Watch eventually resulted in its integration into the clinical setting. This process resulted in securing institutional buy-in and retaining ownership over decision making among frontline staff. Doctors and nurses developed new processes for decision making that made use of the tool alongside their expertise. As the frontline users of Sepsis Watch, nurses also reported that the tool helped them expand their professional skills.
