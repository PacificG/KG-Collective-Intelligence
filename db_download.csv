This model can be applied to any field where an in-field operator may lack the skills to deal with unusual circumstances, while a remote pool of experts can serve multiple in-field operators. Applications can range from remote healthcare through paramedics and first responders, to installation of new climate-neutral energy assets such solar panels or insulation, to deployment of new agricultural and forestry methods.
