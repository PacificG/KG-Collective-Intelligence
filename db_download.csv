Sentry Siria,Provide early warning of a crisis,"In conflict zones airstrikes have devastating consequences – causing civilian deaths and injuries on a massive scale. Densely populated neighbourhoods, hospitals, schools or other locations with high levels of civilians are often targets for strikes. It is challenging to predict when strikes will occur, and to issue time-critical warnings enabling civilians to seek safety from imminent attacks. What is the CCI solution? Sentry, developed by social enterprise Hala Systems, is an indication and warning system that uses a multi-sensor network to generate a real-time awareness of threats and quickly disseminate warnings. Sentry uses acoustic sensor data, reports from people on-the-ground and open media ‘scraping’ to detect warplanes in flight. It then uses artificial intelligence (AI) to validate information from multiple sources, and issues warnings to civilians and global stakeholders. Combining the intelligence of local community actors with a wide range of additional data sources and AI enables Sentry to give accurate warnings to affected civilians and stakeholders. How is it being done? Sentry combines a number of  sensing’ data sources, including data captured by sensors that detect the sound of military aircraft and reports from volunteer “plane spotters” who live near air bases and in conflict zones to predict when and where air strikes will occur. The volunteer “plane spotter” network was an early grassroot response to airstrikes in Syria made up of trusted civilian contacts (including teachers,  ngineers, doctors, farmers). Plane spotters work in shifts and watch for planes, recording information in a smartphone app. Sentry combines this with data from remote acoustic sensors hidden in trees and tall buildings and data scraped from social and local media (by a machine learning algorithm) to confirm information about the plane and flight path. The ‘sensing’ data inputs are  alidated by an AI-based model trained on historical data; the software estimates the possible target and timing of the airstrike by comparing it to past cases of attacks. Sentry then issues alerts to citizens in affected areas five to ten minutes in advance of an airstrike to give them time to escape. Warnings are disseminated through social media (including via chat bots), TV, radio and  n-theground sirens, and direct messages are sent to local civil society organisations, hospitals and schools. Sentry uses blockchain technology to immutably store war crime information and citizen reports collected through the tool. (Source: Nesta UK)",2.0,,,,,,,1.0,,,2.0,,,1.0,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,
HERMES,"Provide real-time situational
information for more effective response","The widespread use of mobile phones means that many people involved in disasters publish information-rich textual and multimedia messages on social media networks, often live and in situ. Following a crisis, both natural or man-made, this data can be used to generate a situational awareness of the event and aftermath, to help governments, aid agencies and other organisations to respond. However, relevant information from social media is typically unstructured, heterogeneous and fragmented over many messages, in such a way that it cannot be directly used. Extracting and processing vast volumes of data quickly and effectively is of paramount importance for supporting emergency crisis relief efforts. What is the CCI solution?
HERMES is a CI tool developed by the Italian National Research Council which enriches available social media data in the aftermath of disasters by identifying relevant Tweets and automatically asking follow-up questions to garner more detailed information from the person who posted the message. It leverages the collective intelligence of affected populations and wider citizens by using socialmedia data posted in crisis events, and applies AI to effectively process the data and maximise  utility. How is it being done? HERMES automatically complements spontaneously published data (i.e. a Tweet) with targeted solicited data by asking the person who posted the Tweet specific questions to gather further detailed information. The system listens to the stream of social media messages related to a disaster. Then, it leverages AI techniques to select a subset of relevant social media users directly involved in the disaster, from which to solicit additional information. HERMES automatically asks targeted questions to selected users, and it collects answers to those questions in real-time. Finally, relevant information obtained via message classification or information extraction is often leveraged to produce and update crisis maps, and shared with Emergency Operation Centers.

Artificial Intelligence in Medical Epidemiology (AIME),Predict a crisis before it happens,"Dengue is a mosquito-borne infection and major international public health concern, with severe dengue affecting many Asian and Latin American countries and up to 2.5 billion people worldwide. A major challenge in many dengue endemic countries is that disease surveillance is often passive and reliant on case reporting by health workers, meaning it can be difficult to ensure completeness and timeliness of data. Often dengue outbreaks have occurred or even passed their peak before they are registered by systems. Time delays and poor predictive capability mean that public health officials are missing vital opportunities for disease control and to implement a timely localised response. Predicting outbreaks is of paramount importance as there is no treatment to prevent or stop dengue, and the WHO recommends that the vaccine only be given to persons with confirmed prior dengue virus infection, thereby leaving large swathes of the population in disease endemic countries at risk.  What is the CCI solution? Artificial intelligence in Medical Epidemiology (AIME) is an early warning system incorporating AI to identify and forecast dengue outbreaks with a high accuracy and spatial precision. AIME leverages the intelligence of local doctors and healthcare professionals and combines this with a wide range of data sources and machine learning to predict (and therefore prevent) disease outbreak.  AIME uses real-time data generated by doctors, who send in notifications of dengue cases via AIME’s subsystem (REDINT); this can be accessed by hospitals within a community/ region, enabling them to immediately update and report dengue cases to the public health municipality. Case data is combined with existing datasets of variables that influence the spread of dengue – from local terrain and elevation to roofing types and thunderstorms, as well as official data about the local population and socioeconomic variables. The AIME platform combines data and uses a machine learning algorithm in order to predict, geo-locate and determine future outbreaks. The platform enables surveillance of current disease outbreaks, by determining their exact location, and can forecast future outbreaks.

Managing Information in Natural Disasters (MIND),Provide real-time situational information for more effective response,"During a natural disaster, access to accurate, consistent and timely information can be limited. This can slow, and sometimes prevent, responders from acting and collaborating in a crisis. As a result, different response efforts may be using different datasets and information, and therefore not supporting the communities most in need. What is the CCI solution? MIND is an automated open source platform created by UN Global Pulse that collects and processes data from a range of sources and presents this data through a single aggregated platform that all responders can use when coordinating response to a natural disaster. How is it being done? The platform is built on an automated data pipeline (using a number of APIs), allowing it to stream and analyse several non-traditional data sets all in one place. This includes data generated by affected communities local to the incident taking place and scraped from Twitter and Google searches, as well as information from Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap about the location, casualty reports from news sources, and data from the International Aid Transparency Initiative, showing details about projects and organisations in the affected areas. The automated collection and processing of the data is triggered based on disaster alerts received from the Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System (GDACS), which is a global system aimed at closing information and coordination gaps.",2.0,,,,,1.0,,2.0,,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,
RapiD (Map with AI),Provide real-time situational information for more effective response,"For 15 years, thousands of volunteers have used OpenStreetMap (OSM) to create a free and open map of the world. The community of mappers help build OSM by adding manually captured data, importing and reviewing open public data or official data (such as satellite images) and annotating features like roads, highways and bridges. While mappers may be remote, local communities can also use the tool to map their local neighbourhoods. Despite the popularity of OSM, many areas remain unmapped, unvalidated or incorrectly labelled. This is mostly because crowd annotation of maps is time- and labourintensive for volunteers and finding an equivalent number of real-life validators is difficult. Maps are not static – particularly in vulnerable regions affected by conflict (such as where borders may be disputed) and environmental crises – so they may require remapping if an area experiences rapid changes in infrastructure. These areas need constant monitoring, which is difficult to achieve manually. Accurate maps play an essential role in crisis situations by supporting the response efforts of frontline workers, aid organisations, national and international government bodies by helping them to understand the scale of impact, and effectively target and coordinate relief. What is the CCI solution? The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a dedicated community that uses OSM to support responses to crises, such as urban floods and migration, by mapping vulnerable regions. In 2018, HOT launched the MapWithAI initiative (in partnership with Facebook) which elevates the collective intelligence of volunteers by using artificial intelligence (AI) to drive the speed, efficiency and scale of mapping efforts. How is it being done? MapWithAI uses computer vision to detect roads and terrain features of the streets on high-resolution satellite imagery. Trained using years of volunteer-labelled satellite data, complex patterns in images are identified by an algorithm known as a deep neural network segmentation model. This model estimates the probability that each pixel is part of a road, predicts and draws potential roads, and generates an enhanced image for the volunteer community through an editing tool called RapiD. Using RapiD, volunteers verify the AI generated roads, helping to identify errors in the model and contribute to its improvement. The project initially focused on the response to flooding in Kerala, India, but has since been integrated into the HOT volunteer-management platform for deployment on other projects. Project managers and volunteers can opt-in to use the tool or continue mapping without it. Using RapiD, volunteers are able to create maps of disaster affected regions more quickly. Projects carried out through the HOT task manager platform draw on contributions from a wide range of participants including local volunteers and frontline responders, particularly for validation of remote mapping efforts.

To prevent and limit these outbreaks, a vast amount of data is required to identify and remove breeding grounds, such as standing water. Monitoring locations across a city or region is a laborious process that requires a large number of people to regularly collect data. What is the CCI solution? Utilising a citizen network in and around the city of Cali, the Premise platform provided a tool to allow affected communities to crowdsource data and monitor conditions in hard-to-reach geographies. Citizens are trained through the Premise app and offered micropayments as incentives to collect data, which can then be visualised for authorities to monitor and respond to mosquito breeding sites. The platform also enables a collective mitigation response by informing citizens of best practice in vector surveillance and control. How is it being done? The Premise crowdsource platform relies on a four step process: configure, collect, quality control and visualise. First, the city authority and Premise community managers establish the questions that need to be asked to the citizen network to collect the data that is required for a targeted response. This is configured into the platform with appropriate instructions to ensure a consistency and quality to data collection. The citizen contributors’ network then begin collecting data, incentivised through behavioural nudges and micropayments, and upload the data to the Premise platform. Premise utilises AI to quality control the uploaded data and identify any false or duplicative entries. Finally, this data is visualised on the Premise platform for both the community and authorities to work together to identify and remove potential breeding grounds.

eBayanihan,"Provide real-time situational
information for more effective response ","When a natural disaster strikes, such as Typhoon Lando (Koppu) in the Philippines, it can be challenging for affected communities to communicate with first responders about the scale of the disaster and the support that is required. Equally, first responders, operational  managers and government agencies often use a multitude of data sources to coordinate response that do not always reflect the support needs of affected groups. What is the CCI solution? eBayanihan is a muti-channel platform that enables citizens to view and upload reports of natural disasters and community needs, providing a direct link to first responders, operational managers and government agencies. Citizens are therefore able to express the support that is  equired in their affected communities, rather than responders focusing on the mapped impact of the natural disaster. First responders, operational managers and government agencies therefore have a single source of data that informs how to target their response, visualised through a dashboard and interactive map. How is it being done? Affected communities uploaded citizen reports (CitReports) that describe the damage caused by Typhoon Lando, as well as the needs of the community, such as shelter, food and water via multiple channels including SMS, web and an app. Machine learning algorithms help to model and validate these crowdsourced CitReports – categorising and visualising them for operational teams to respond to. These feed into a real-time dashboard visualising incidents and automating notifications to people managing, responding to or coordinating the response of natural disasters.

Project Dorian,"Label datasets for AI by frontline responders, human-in-the-loop technology development","Ensuring human oversight of algorithms after deployment can help to identify and correct these errors in a timely manner. For this project, a group of volunteers from the Montgomery County Community Emergency Response Team (MCERT) helped to check and correct labels assigned by the AI classifier. This participatory approach, known as human-in-the-loop, was used to verify the classifications being made by the system and correct any mistakes in real time. The process also resulted in a novel image dataset with expert labels of damage to further train the algorithm and improve its accuracy during future deployments.During the two-week period that followed the landfall of Hurricane Dorian, the system was deployed to collect and filter social media images. Approximately 160,000 images were tagged as relevant by the system, with ~26,000 of these containing some damage content. All images that the system ranked as severe or mild were sent for human validation. Using a dedicated web-interface for microtasking to support humanitarian efforts, local domain experts from MCERT examined this evolving sample, performing a two-stage verification. They first checked if the image contained damage content and then assigned a severity level based on a predetermined taxonomy. The research team also developed a detailed tutorial to ensure that all labellers were approaching the task in a consistent manner. The corrections made by the community responders helped to identify common types of errors made by the algorithm. For example, the AI system struggled with images taken from afar or in low-light and poor resolution settings. Isolating this weakness helped the technical team to develop targeted improvements and the response teams to better understand the potential added value of the AI tool for their operations during crisis response.
