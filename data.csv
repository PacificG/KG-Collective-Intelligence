Project Dorian,"Label datasets for AI by frontline responders, human-in-the-loop technology development","Ensuring human oversight of algorithms after deployment can help to identify and correct these errors in a timely manner. For this project, a group of volunteers from the Montgomery County Community Emergency Response Team (MCERT) helped to check and correct labels assigned by the AI classifier. This participatory approach, known as human-in-the-loop, was used to verify the classifications being made by the system and correct any mistakes in real time. The process also resulted in a novel image dataset with expert labels of damage to further train the algorithm and improve its accuracy during future deployments.During the two-week period that followed the landfall of Hurricane Dorian, the system was deployed to collect and filter social media images. Approximately 160,000 images were tagged as relevant by the system, with ~26,000 of these containing some damage content. All images that the system ranked as severe or mild were sent for human validation. Using a dedicated web-interface for microtasking to support humanitarian efforts, local domain experts from MCERT examined this evolving sample, performing a two-stage verification. They first checked if the image contained damage content and then assigned a severity level based on a predetermined taxonomy. The research team also developed a detailed tutorial to ensure that all labellers were approaching the task in a consistent manner. The corrections made by the community responders helped to identify common types of errors made by the algorithm. For example, the AI system struggled with images taken from afar or in low-light and poor resolution settings. Isolating this weakness helped the technical team to develop targeted improvements and the response teams to better understand the potential added value of the AI tool for their operations during crisis response.

Muonde Trust,Enable Agro-Pastoral Restoration in Zimbabwe,"3 particularly when competing interests and behaviours of different stakeholder groups need to be accounted for. Ecological restoration initiatives have often ignored the role of indigenous people and local groups in maintaining ecosystems and failed to account for the local history and political context. In Mazvihwa Communal Area, Zimbabwe, there are ongoing land management problems where woodland grazing areas are increasingly being converted to cropland. After the model was finalised, the Muonde team held workshops with local traditional authorities, including the local Chief, the ward head (machinda), and the individual village heads (sabhuku). In these workshops, they used the model to visualise different actions and resulting impacts, which helped local stakeholders to discuss land management practices, past actions that had resulted in drought and the challenges associated with their agro-pastoral system. These discussions led to policy changes that allowed the reuse of fallow fields for farming.

Ecological restoration initiatives have often ignored the role of indigenous people and local groups in maintaining ecosystems and failed to account for the local history and political context. In Mazvihwa Communal Area, Zimbabwe, there are ongoing land management problems where woodland grazing areas are increasingly being converted to cropland. After the model was finalised, the Muonde team held workshops with local traditional authorities, including the local Chief, the ward head (machinda), and the individual village heads (sabhuku). In these workshops, they used the model to visualise different actions and resulting impacts, which helped local stakeholders to discuss land management practices, past actions that had resulted in drought and the challenges associated with their agro-pastoral system. These discussions led to policy changes that allowed the reuse of fallow fields for farming. Months after these workshops, the community members reported that the model helped them realise the interaction between their different behaviours, understand the systemic drivers in the ecosystem and to take responsibility for the collective action that was necessary to improve outcomes.

Sepsis Watch,Enable participatory AI modeling in healthcare,"Sepsis Watch is a sepsis detection and management platform that uses deep learning to predict the likelihood of a patient developing sepsis. It was co-created by a multidisciplinary team that included hospital staff and a technical team to improve the clinical outcomes associated with sepsis, which was a major issue for the local hospital. Machine learning technologies are increasingly being developed for healthcare settings. These models are often created by engineering teams outside of the clinical environment and implementation decisions are made at the leadership level, rather than with the involvement of clinicians or nurses who are expected to use and integrate the tool into their existing workflows. Research has also suggested that machine learning models in healthcare have poor generalisability. This means their performance suffers when they are used in real-world settings where the local data follows
statistically different patterns to the datasets they were trained on. The Sepsis Watch model was created in close collaboration with clinicians over two and a half years, with participation integrated throughout the AI development pipeline. Throughout the process the team placed a strong emphasis on developing trust between the individuals involved and also in the technology solution. The thirty month co-design process for Sepsis Watch eventually resulted in its integration into the clinical setting.

Artificial Intelligence in Medical Epidemiology (AIME),Predict a crisis before it happens,"Dengue is a mosquito-borne infection and major international public health concern, with severe dengue affecting many Asian and Latin American countries and up to 2.5 billion people worldwide. A major challenge in many dengue endemic countries is that disease surveillance is often passive and reliant on case reporting by health workers, meaning it can be difficult to ensure completeness and timeliness of data. Often dengue outbreaks have occurred or even passed their peak before they are registered by systems. Time delays and poor predictive capability mean that public health officials are missing vital opportunities for disease control and to implement a timely localised response. Predicting outbreaks is of paramount importance as there is no treatment to prevent or stop dengue, and the WHO recommends that the vaccine only be given to persons with confirmed prior dengue virus infection, thereby leaving large swathes of the population in disease endemic countries at risk.

RapiD (Map with AI),Provide real-time situational information for more effective response,"For 15 years, thousands of volunteers have used OpenStreetMap (OSM) to create a free and open map of the world. The community of mappers help build OSM by adding manually captured data, importing and reviewing open public data or official data (such as satellite images) and annotating features like roads, highways and bridges. While mappers may be remote, local communities can also use the tool to map their local neighbourhoods. Despite the popularity of OSM, many areas remain unmapped, unvalidated or incorrectly labelled. This is mostly because crowd annotation of maps is time- and labourintensive for volunteers and finding an equivalent number of real-life validators is difficult. Maps are not static – particularly in vulnerable regions affected by conflict (such as where borders may be disputed) and environmental crises – so they may require remapping if an area experiences rapid changes in infrastructure. These areas need constant monitoring, which is difficult to achieve manually. Accurate maps play an essential role in crisis situations by supporting the response efforts of frontline workers, aid organisations, national and international government bodies by helping them to understand the scale of impact, and effectively target and coordinate relief. What is the CCI solution? The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a dedicated community that uses OSM to support responses to crises, such as urban floods and migration, by mapping vulnerable regions. In 2018, HOT launched the MapWithAI initiative (in partnership with Facebook) which elevates the collective intelligence of volunteers by using artificial intelligence (AI) to drive the speed, efficiency and scale of mapping efforts. How is it being done? MapWithAI uses computer vision to detect roads and terrain features of the streets on high-resolution satellite imagery. Trained using years of volunteer-labelled satellite data, complex patterns in images are identified by an algorithm known as a deep neural network segmentation model. This model estimates the probability that each pixel is part of a road, predicts and draws potential roads, and generates an enhanced image for the volunteer community through an editing tool called RapiD. Using RapiD, volunteers verify the AI generated roads, helping to identify errors in the model and contribute to its improvement. The project initially focused on the response to flooding in Kerala, India, but has since been integrated into the HOT volunteer-management platform for deployment on other projects. Project managers and volunteers can opt-in to use the tool or continue mapping without it. Using RapiD, volunteers are able to create maps of disaster affected regions more quickly.

Common Social Accountability Platform (CSAP),Solicite ideas and priorities from communities for post-crisis rebuilding in Somalia,"Following decades of unrest, Somalia is starting to move towards recovery. However, government capacity to deliver services and respond to citizen needs remains limited. A lack of established accountability mechanisms not only prevents government decisions from being informed and guided by citizen input and feedback, but also reduces citizens’ trust
in government to respond to their needs. In addition, there are limited channels and opportunities for meaningful interaction between citizens and the numerous aid agencies delivering support in the country. The charity Africa’s Voices launched the Common Social Accountability Platform (CSAP) in Somalia in 2018 to increase the inclusion of citizens in decision making across governance, humanitarian and development programmes. CSAP tackles the gap in connecting Somali citizens to decision making through a CI approach by maximising the scale and inclusivity of dialogue between citizens and authorities. In addition, CSAP provides a robust digital platform to gather and analyse evidence on citizen perspectives (including by using AI). The charity partners with a wide range of aid-related organisations and national and international government bodies (including Somalia Stability Fund, Oxfam, European Union, UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office) to deliver projects, and provide recommendations to external stakeholders (such as policymakers). CSAP adopts a collective intelligence approach by crowdsourcing opinions from affected communities, producing citizen-generated data, and conducting complex data analytics (including AI) to analyse feedback at scale. The platform uses Africa’s Voices’ interactive radio method for building dialogue and gathering public opinion. Radio programming and SMS messaging create a platform that Somali citizens actively engage in, whilst simultaneously allowing for feedback received from citizen SMS messages to be robustly analysed, understood and ultimately, acted upon. Their method gathers insights from conversations held in local languages, on a scale otherwise unattainable for qualitative methods. The data collected is interpreted by qualitative research techniques, data science and AI to analyse discussions in local languages.

behaviours and interventions for crisis recovery ","Natural resource ecosystems (e.g. forest, agricultural, land-use management, water) are complex to model and understand because they are affected by a wide range of factors including both environmental and human behaviours. Knowledge related to ecosystems and the factors that impact them is distributed between numerous stakeholders, such as scientists, local residents and frontline managers, who often have distinct (and sometimes competing) interests. This makesit difficult to understand the short- and longterm’ impacts of environment and resource management decisions, and to tackle resource issues that require collective decision making and agreement. In the case of the Sequía Project in Uruguay, local farmers were struggling to identify and plan adaptation strategies in the face of severe drought. What is the CCI solution? Companion modelling uses Agent BasedModels (ABMs) and role-playing games to help represent and simulate socio-economic systems for natural resource management.  This participatory approach uses the collective intelligence of a wide range of stakeholders to design and implement ABMs, and features interactive simulations enabling participating stakeholders to test different scenarios and outcomes. How is it being done?The underlying concept of companion modelling is to use role-playing games to enable stakeholders to interact with a model or simulation of a specified resource ecosystem, and to modify the behaviour of various agents in order to understand the impact of different uses of resources.

WeFly Portal,"Participatory design for remote or
in-situ sensing","Small-and-lightweight drones are increasingly being used around the world in managing  disaster response and relief operations  during and after crisis events. They offer an opportunity to understand the level of damage caused, deliver resources, support search and  rescue effects, and map affected areas. Drones are a particularly helpful tool during large
scale natural disasters, such as earthquakes, but they need to be deployed in a timely and coordinated fashion in order to ensure they are used effectively. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) registration and flight authorisation in many countries (including countries that experience frequent earthquakes, such as Nepal) is a lengthy paper-based process, requiring individuals and organisations to visit multiple offices. This makes it challenging to quickly authorise drone flight when it’s needed most, to understand who is operating drones in disasters, and ultimately slows down the relief response due to poor coordination and accountability amongst responders. What is the CCI solution? WeRobotics have developed a prototype SMS messaging platform, the WeFly Portal, to coordinate drone deployment during disaster response. The portal acts as a CI tool by bringing together data from drone pilots and flight authority officials. Through the tool, users can register drone pilots and approve flight permissions quickly, significantly reducing the risk of drone collisions while improving coordination and accelerating response efforts. The  latform uses AI-enabled chatbots to solicit the relevant information from drone pilots. WeFly also integrates citizen-generated data (i.e. public complaints) to aid authority decision making around drone use. How is it being done? Drone pilots send requests for flight permission directly to relevant authorities through an online app. The app uses an interactive WhatsApp bot through  hich pilots can request flight permissions and quickly submit details from their phone in a user-friendly way, and the public can raise complaints or inquiries about drone flights. In addition, the prototype includes a website with public information on registering a UAV in Nepal, including the rules, regulations, contact of authorities, and more.

(Source: Nesta UK)",2.0,,,,,,,,1.0,,,1.0,,1.0,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,"Sense Collaborate_ Community Collaborate_ Public sector, NGO ","Sense Collaborate_ Community Collaborate_ Public sector, NGO  Small-and-lightweight drones are increasingly being used around the world in managing  disaster response and relief operations  during and after crisis events. They offer an opportunity to understand the level of damage caused, deliver resources, support search and  rescue effects, and map affected areas. Drones are a particularly helpful tool during large
scale natural disasters, such as earthquakes, but they need to be deployed in a timely and coordinated fashion in order to ensure they are used effectively. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) registration and flight authorisation in many countries (including countries that experience frequent earthquakes, such as Nepal) is a lengthy paper-based process, requiring individuals and organisations to visit multiple offices. This makes it challenging to quickly authorise drone flight when it’s needed most, to understand who is operating drones in disasters, and ultimately slows down the relief response due to poor coordination and accountability amongst responders. What is the CCI solution? WeRobotics have developed a prototype SMS messaging platform, the WeFly Portal, to coordinate drone deployment during disaster response. The portal acts as a CI tool by bringing together data from drone pilots and flight authority officials. Through the tool, users can register drone pilots and approve flight permissions quickly, significantly reducing the risk of drone collisions while improving coordination and accelerating response efforts. The  latform uses AI-enabled chatbots to solicit the relevant information from drone pilots. WeFly also integrates citizen-generated data (i.e. public complaints) to aid authority decision making around drone use. How is it being done? Drone pilots send requests for flight permission directly to relevant authorities through an online app. The app uses an interactive WhatsApp bot through  hich pilots can request flight permissions and quickly submit details from their phone in a user-friendly way, and the public can raise complaints or inquiries about drone flights. In addition, the prototype includes a website with public information on registering a UAV in Nepal, including the rules, regulations, contact of authorities, and more. The site also includes a secure web platform  or relevant authorities to review flight permission/extension requests (including pilot information, geolocation, flight and flight plans), complaints or inquiries raised by the public, and a view of nearby flights. At the end of the simulation, the model reports   series of statistics, which capture the overall health of the population as well as the final  status of the aid centres (e.g. food  istribution points).

Sentry Siria,Provide early warning of a crisis,"In conflict zones airstrikes have devastating consequences – causing civilian deaths and injuries on a massive scale. Densely populated neighbourhoods, hospitals, schools or other locations with high levels of civilians are often targets for strikes. It is challenging to predict when strikes will occur, and to issue time-critical warnings enabling civilians to seek safety from imminent attacks. What is the CCI solution? Sentry, developed by social enterprise Hala Systems, is an indication and warning system that uses a multi-sensor network to generate a real-time awareness of threats and quickly disseminate warnings. Sentry uses acoustic sensor data, reports from people on-the-ground and open media ‘scraping’ to detect warplanes in flight. It then uses artificial intelligence (AI) to validate information from multiple sources, and issues warnings to civilians and global stakeholders. Combining the intelligence of local community actors with a wide range of additional data sources and AI enables Sentry to give accurate warnings to affected civilians and stakeholders. How is it being done? Sentry combines a number of  sensing’ data sources, including data captured by sensors that detect the sound of military aircraft and reports from volunteer “plane spotters” who live near air bases and in conflict zones to predict when and where air strikes will occur. The volunteer “plane spotter” network was an early grassroot response to airstrikes in Syria made up of trusted civilian contacts (including teachers,  ngineers, doctors, farmers). Plane spotters work in shifts and watch for planes, recording information in a smartphone app. Sentry combines this with data from remote acoustic sensors hidden in trees and tall buildings and data scraped from social and local media (by a machine learning algorithm) to confirm information about the plane and flight path. The ‘sensing’ data inputs are  alidated by an AI-based model trained on historical data; the software estimates the possible target and timing of the airstrike by comparing it to past cases of attacks. Sentry then issues alerts to citizens in affected areas five to ten minutes in advance of an airstrike to give them time to escape. Warnings are disseminated through social media (including via chat bots), TV, radio and  n-theground sirens, and direct messages are sent to local civil society organisations, hospitals and schools.

Modelling humanitarian relief in Haiti,Model behaviours and interventions for crisis planning,"During and following a crisis situation, decision making at both the individual and the collective level changes rapidly due to the severe disruption caused to people’s daily lives. To manage and respond to a crisis effectively, and to aid humanitarian efforts during a crisis, it is important to understand and anticipate how different groups and individuals will react  n a spatially and temporally precise way. Challenges in understanding people’s behaviour during a crisis are often compounded by a lack of spatial data in less developed countries. Even in cases where spatial data is available, it often lags behind what has changed on-the-ground – for instance when the physical landscape has altered due to a natural disaster. What is the CCI  olution? This case study outlines a prototype of an agent-based model (ABM) integrating GIS, crowdsourced geographic information and other sources of publicly available data, which seeks to explore how aid might be distributed to better support affected communities. The model uses the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti which is estimated to have killed 230,000 people and  eft more than 1.6 million people homeless. The model explores how affected communities search for food following an earthquake and allows the user to explore different scenario options for aid distribution. How is it being done? The model uses a diverse range of crowdsourced data including geographic information about population density, relative level of devastation, existing transportation networks, location of aid centres, and environmental parameters. The researchers used publicly available (open) data to estimate population density and OpenStreetMap data. The simulation produces a map showing the movement of individuals throughout the environment and the spread of information about aid (e.g. food) availability, as well as graphs tracking how individual agents use ifferent aid centres over time. Over time more and more agents become aware of their nearest food distribution point as well as other distribution points, as information spreads throughout the system. Agents then evaluate if it is worthwhile for them to go and get food. They do this by planning the shortest path to the food via the road network.

America in One Room,Use deliberative democracy polling to investigate better political decision-making,"To practice democracy at its purest, in a time of political polarization, an experiment called America in One Room, organized by Helena magazine in collaboration with Stanford Univeristy, brought together the most representative sample of the electorate in U.S. history. A stratified random sample of 523 registered voters, recruited by NORC at the University of Chicago, was identified out of millions of Americans through a rigorous scientific process in order to represent the political, cultural, and demographic diversity of the American electorate. Helena brought each American to a single location — a resort in Dallas, Texas. For four days, the delegates participated in an unprecedented deliberation on the critical issues facing the United States. In a process called “deliberative democracy polling”, the 523 participants began by taking an in-depth questionnaire, stating their views on five key issue areas identified in earlier polling as most vital to the 2020 presidential election. The group was then given a 60-page briefing document, prepared and vetted by a distinguished group of policy experts from across the political spectrum. The document was balanced with arguments for and against specific policy proposals across the five issue areas.

Ants review,Enable blockchain incentives for science peer review,"The peer review process, which is very costly in terms of time and intellectual investment, not only is not remunerated by the journals but is also not openly recognized by the academic community as a relevant scientific output for a researcher. Therefore, scientific dissemination is affected in timeliness, quality, and fairness. Here, to solve this issue, researchers Trovò and Massari propose a blockchain-based incentive system that rewards scientists for peer-reviewing other scientists' work and that builds up trust and reputation.

Mexico public sector,Keeping public administration officials accountable,"In 2010, the Mexican government introduced a performance evaluation system across all departments to keep track of the impact of public programming and spending. The system, based on the Logical Framework methodology from USAID, is intended to increase accountability and improve results of public service delivery.

The evaluation includes open text entries where civil servants write a brief justification to account for goals that weren’t met. The UNDP Accelerator Lab is mining the text entries using NLP to cluster and rank dominant themes across this vast public service dataset. By training an AI model to compare text entries with a set of predefined common causes and identify novel themes, they’re aiming to improve the reporting process for civil servants in the future.
